## Aim

To find the list of fruits available in the supermarket using the INTERSECT operator.

## Question

Consider a supermarket database.

Table 'fruit' has the list of all fruits available in the market, and some of them could be out of stock.
Table 'inventory' has the updated list of items in the supermarket.

Write a query to find the list of fruits available in the supermarket. The f_name column has the name of the fruits and inv_name has the name of the items in the inventory. Output the name of the fruits.

## SQL Queries Used

### Find Common Fruits

```sql
/* Write a query to find the list of fruits available in the supermarket.
(f_name column has the name of the fruits and inv_name has the name of inventories, you are suppose to output the name of the fruits.)*/
SELECT f_name FROM fruit
INTERSECT
SELECT inv_name FROM inventory;
```

## Output

```text
┌────────────┐
│   f_name   │
